White blood cells (WBCs) are a portion of the immune system 
which fights against germs. Leukemia is the most common blood 
cancer which may lead to death. It occurs due to the production
of a large number of immature WBCs in the bone marrow that 
destroy healthy cells. To overcome the severity of this disease,
it is necessary to diagnose the shapes of immature cells at 
an early stage that ultimately reduces the modality rate of 
the patients. Recently different types of segmentation and 
classification methods are presented based upon deep-learning
(DL) models but still have some limitations. This research 
aims to propose a modified DL approach for the accurate 
segmentation of leukocytes using VAE's and Modified U-Net.
